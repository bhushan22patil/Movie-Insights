# Movie-Insights
Some interesting insights into a few movies released between 1916 and 2016.  
Exploring the data, to gain insights into the movies, actors, directors, and collections.

## Software
1. Anaconda 
2. Jupyter Natebook
3. Python 3.0

## Installation
You will need various Python packages (or synonymously, libraries) for specific purposes. Anaconda is an open-source distribution that simplifies package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system 'Conda'.

I strongly recommend using Anaconda to install Python as well as the packages, since it comes preloaded with most of the packages youâ€™ll need.

Anaconda can be downloaded from [Here](anaconda.org) and can be installed like any other normal software. There is no need to download Python separately; the Anaconda installer will do this for you. Make sure you select Python 3.x while downloading Anaconda.

The document *Installing Python using Anaconda* provides instructions for installing Python and the Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda.
